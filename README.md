# Recipe Archive

This is a Frontend for a private Project. It uses https://github.com/j-toscani/rezepte-api as its API. The goal is to have one place where you can find all recipes stored somewhere in your home.

## Key functionalities

- Find all recipes in one place, no matter where they are
- Be able to search those recipes by name/main ingredients
- Organise cooking-books and magazines
